## 🚨 EASIER ALTERNATIVE:

Let me push the files directly from this environment. I'll need to use git commands from here.

**Should I do this for you?**

This would:
- Push all files to your GitHub repo
- You just need to provide a GitHub Personal Access Token
- Takes 1 minute

**To get token:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name: "Upload from agent"
4. Select: `repo` (all checkboxes under repo)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token (starts with `ghp_...`)
7. Give it to me

Then I'll push everything for you!

## 🤔 Which Method Do You Prefer?

**B)** I guide you to create key files manually through GitHub web (10 minutes)

**C)** You download files somehow and upload yourself

Which is easiest for you? 😊
