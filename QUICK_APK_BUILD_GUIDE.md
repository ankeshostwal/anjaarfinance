## Need the Project Files?

To build the APK, you need the project files. I can provide them in two ways:

- You clone/download
- Build from there

**Option B: Direct Download**
- I package the project as ZIP
- You download
- Extract and build

**Which method do you prefer?**

## Alternative: Direct APK Link

If you want the fastest solution:

1. I can configure a public build
2. Upload to a build service
3. Provide you direct APK download link
4. You just download and install

**Would this be easier for you?**

## What Do You Want to Do?

Please choose:

**A)** Use Expo Web Interface (I'll guide you)
**B)** Build using command line (I'll provide files)
**C)** I provide ready APK link (fastest)
